# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
*<p align='left'> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and it is estimated that 659,000 Americans die from CVD each year. The cause of CVD is complicated and risk factors that contribute to CVD are still unclear. Thus it is imperative to identify the direct indicators for cardiovascular disease in order to facilitate CVD diagnosis and treatment. In this project, I explored the relationship among a few potential cardiovascular risk factors, then checked on their predictibility against CVD through various machine learning models.</p>*
## 1. Data
I utilized Kaggle [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) which contains 70,000 medical exam records of 11 potential risk factors for CVD and the diagnostic result (1: has CVD, 0: normal). Those 12 variables are Age, Height, Weight, Gender, Systolic/Diastolic blood pressures, Cholesterol levels, Glucose, Smoking, Alcohol intake and Physical activity. </p>
## 2. Data Wrangling
### Part 1. Indentify the hottest topics in the recent CVD research<br>
<b>Method:</b> I utilized the NCBI API to request all the publications between 2020 and 2021 with 'cardiovascular' in the title, scraped in total 64,801 keywords from 17,632 records, obtained frequecy of each unique keywords, grouped similar keywords through fuzzy match and visualized Top 100 most frequeny keywords with word cloud.<br>
<b>Result:</b><br><img src="word_cloud.png" width="400" height=200><br>
Based on the word cloud above, it seems latest cardiovascular researches are focused on COVID (which is obvious but not included in the Kaggle dataset), as well as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, obseity, which correspond to CVD risk factors Systolic/Diastolic blood pressures, Glucose, Cholesterol, Height/Weight, respectively.<br>
